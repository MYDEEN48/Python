# 🚢 Titanic Data Analysis (Python)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the famous **Titanic dataset** to uncover insights about passenger survival patterns. Using **Python for data analysis and visualization**, we explore relationships between features like age, gender, class, and survival. The project demonstrates data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and insights that could guide predictive modeling.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Load and preprocess Titanic dataset.
* Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.
* Identify patterns and correlations affecting survival.
* Visualize findings with clear and interpretable charts.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

* **Python**
* **Pandas** – data manipulation
* **NumPy** – numerical operations
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – data visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook** – analysis & reporting

## 📊 Example Analysis

```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("data/titanic.csv")

# Survival count
sns.countplot(data=df, x="Survived")
plt.show()

# Survival by gender
sns.barplot(x="Sex", y="Survived", data=df)
plt.show()

# Survival by passenger class
sns.barplot(x="Pclass", y="Survived", data=df)
plt.show()
```

## 📈 Key Insights (Sample)

* 👩 Women had a much higher survival rate than men.
* 💰 Passengers in **1st class** had a significantly better chance of survival.
* 👶 Children had higher survival rates compared to adults.
* 🚢 Most 3rd class passengers had lower survival chances.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-data-analysis.git
   cd titanic-data-analysis
   ```
2. Install required libraries:

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Build a **predictive survival model** using machine learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
* Perform **feature engineering** for better predictions.
* Create an **interactive dashboard** (Plotly / Dash / Power BI).
